   - *Dependency*: Database setup for vehicle details.
   - *Priority*: High

**Medium Priority Stories**
3. As a fleet owner, I want to filter vehicles by status (e.g., active, idle, offline) so that I can focus on operational vehicles.
   - *Dependency*: Real-time communication protocol.
   - *Priority*: Medium

---

### **2. Vehicle Data Communication**
**High Priority Stories**
1. As a vehicle system, I want to send critical data like speed, location, and health to the server using MQTT so that it can be tracked in real-time.
   - *Dependency*: IoT device setup in vehicles.
   - *Priority*: High

2. As a fleet owner, I want the system to notify me when data communication from a vehicle is interrupted so that I can investigate.
   - *Dependency*: Monitoring mechanisms for IoT/MQTT.
   - *Priority*: High

**Low Priority Stories**
3. As a vehicle system, I want to periodically send trip summaries to the server so that it can be used for generating analytics.
   - *Dependency*: Data aggregation module.
   - *Priority*: Low

---

### **3. Software/Firmware Updates**
**High Priority Stories**
1. As a system administrator, I want to initiate OTA updates for a group of vehicles so that updates can be managed remotely.
   - *Dependency*: FOTA capability in vehicle firmware.
   - *Priority*: High

2. As a system, I want to provide a status report for updates (e.g., success, failed) so that administrators can track them.
   - *Dependency*: Update monitoring framework.
   - *Priority*: High

**Medium Priority Stories**
3. As a fleet owner, I want to retry failed updates on specific vehicles so that I can ensure compliance.
   - *Dependency*: Error-handling mechanisms in FOTA.
   - *Priority*: Medium

**Low Priority Stories**
4. As a system, I want to notify the fleet owner when updates are complete so that they are aware of new versions in use.
   - *Dependency*: Notification system.
   - *Priority*: Low

---

### **4. Live Monitoring**
**High Priority Stories**
1. As a fleet owner, I want to see live health metrics of vehicles (e.g., battery, temperature) on the dashboard so that I can make informed decisions.
   - *Dependency*: Sensor integration in vehicles.
   - *Priority*: High

2. As a fleet owner, I want to access live speed and location data for each vehicle so that I can assess driver behavior.
   - *Dependency*: Real-time data streaming.
   - *Priority*: High

**Medium Priority Stories**
3. As a fleet owner, I want to receive automated maintenance alerts so that I can reduce downtime.
   - *Dependency*: Maintenance scheduling engine.
   - *Priority*: Medium

**Low Priority Stories**
4. As a fleet owner, I want to analyze historical travel and maintenance records so that I can optimize operations.
   - *Dependency*: Data storage and analytics module.
   - *Priority*: Low

---

### **5. Emergency Handling**
**High Priority Stories**
1. As a vehicle system, I want to send an SOS alert to nearby vehicles when a breakdown occurs so that help can arrive quickly.
   - *Dependency*: Peer-to-peer communication setup.
   - *Priority*: High

2. As a vehicle system, I want to send an SOS alert to the fleet owner so that they are informed immediately.
   - *Dependency*: Server-side alerting system.
   - *Priority*: High

**Medium Priority Stories**
3. As a fleet owner, I want to see the live status of the emergency on my dashboard so that I can manage resources effectively.
   - *Dependency*: Real-time alert integration.
   - *Priority*: Medium

**Low Priority Stories**
4. As a fleet owner, I want to receive a post-event report for emergencies so that I can assess the cause and resolution.
   - *Dependency*: Logging and reporting module.
   - *Priority*: Low
